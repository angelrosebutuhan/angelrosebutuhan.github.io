				<h2>School works.</h2>
				<p><br>	There is not much going on in my life apart from doing absolutely nothing and finishing a bunch of my assignments that I have been procrastinating since forever. Back then, I kept on saying to myself that once I got to college I would have fun as much as I can. I have been dreaming of exploring things that seems interesting but right now that I am already a college student, something just don't feel right. It felt like nothing really changed and I'm still the same old me.

					<h2>Netflix for now, cramming later.</h2>
					<p><br>	School works these days were never ending and I realized that we must always find time to relax and take care of yourself, mind and soul. I love watching videos with interesting contents, I can sit all day long just watching and not get bored. Any genre is fine with me and I watch movies created by Filipinos, Americans, Koreans, Chinese and the likes sometimes I even watch Anime as long as the story entice me.   </p>

				<h2>Low-key pabuhat.</h2>
				<p><br>	During senior high most of the time I was grouped with people who are good in programming and as a result I tend to get lazy about trying to learn the codes and just rely on them but all thanks to my everyday haggard look my teachers think that I did all the work for our group project when in fact, it is just how I usually look.  People must really stop judging others by their appearance.  </p>

				<h2><span class="desc">Our family's Unico Hijo.</h2>
				<p><br>	This cute guy here is Putim, his name is self-explanatory, and it is because of the color of his fur. He might look behave in the picture but he's not, he would always bite and scratch us. I got really nervous the first time he bite me but as time goes by it just felt like a routine to me. This little fur baby brings joy and comfort to my whole family. Actually, his mere existence relieves the stress that we feel.</p>

				<h2>Programming is cool.</h2>
				<p><br>	Programmers in movies amazed me when I was in Junior High. They looked really cool and I wished to become one of them but reality hits me -- it is not as easy as what I saw them doing. I really love programming especially when I understand the lesson but once I got stuck and there is no simple YouTube tutorials available, I would start to think that IT field were not meant for me. In other words, I easily get discouraged therefore, I am setting up Plan B just in case I did not land a job as a software engineer and that is to become an IT professor. I know that I am still aiming too high but I would study and work hard so that I can still help those who have the same dream as me.</p>

				<h2>Family always.</h2>
				<p><br>	My family have of 4 members --my father, elder sister, me and Putim but we are not complete in this photo because it is really hard to take picture with Putim because he would throw tantrums and would not stay still for even a minute.  My father rarely cooks but when he does it tastes like it was from a 5-star hotel, as he claims he is our family’s Chef Boy Logro. Meanwhile, my sister is our goal setter she’s got a knack for turning visions into reality. She would keep on telling us that we must save money and invest it in a business. She tried selling different products such as clothes and foods, but as of now she is busy in pig farming.</p>
